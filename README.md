This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## The plan

A WP Audit interactive app that allows you to log in and save progress on an audit checklist, and give it a name.

A table of audits with the following columns:
- associated user
- last modified time
- title
- audit JSON, where each checklist item also has a checked field
